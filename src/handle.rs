/// Types that manages access to a resource.

/// library. Often, a pointer to the resource is needed to implement methods in other modules that
/// wrap the same C library, but the pointer should not be accessible from outside of the crate.

/// The `Handle` trait allows a struct to hand out access to an owned resource across module
/// boundaries. Because the `Handle` trait is not exported from the crate, the owned resources will
/// not be accessible from outside the crate.

/// owned resource across module boundaries without exposing the resource outside of the crate.
